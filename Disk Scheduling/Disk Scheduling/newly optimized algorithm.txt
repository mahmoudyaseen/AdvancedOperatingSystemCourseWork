In this algorithm the head is always initially at position 0 unlike the six classical disk scheduling algorithms. We sort the cylinder input blocks in an ascending order. The head goes through the requests sequentially serving the input request right in front of it until it reaches the last one in the request queue. Worst case for this algorithm is when the requests are positioned at the last cylinder so if we had for example 200 cylinders, the worst case would occur when the requests are at position 200 or very near to it.
